# SDL_FreeImage
SDL natively only supports a handful of image formats. And even with the extra SDL_Image library the count is still less then a dozen image formats. FreeImage on the otherhand supports 35 file formats. Born from a need to display realtime changes to an image, in a format not supported by SDL, this library allows one to convert back and forth between SDL_Surface objects and FreeImage FIBitmap structures.
